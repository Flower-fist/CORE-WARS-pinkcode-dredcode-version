# CORE-WARS-pinkcode/dredcode-version
this WIP core war implentation has a custom version of Redcode that will
be named (pinkcode or dredcode (I can't decide which))
Please note that I'm using a class to internally store commands at runtime,
tell me if you know of a better method.
anyhow, I'll write a pinkcode manual as soon as it can run said programs.
also it dosen't have P-space, instruction modifiers, labels,
for/rof and the other psuedo-opcodes,
and I'm sooo stupidly lazy that I've removed indirect addresing.
scared yet? that why it's dredcode.
# have fun with:
The fact that I implemented a class for redcode commands despite my hatred of OOP style code,
My bad commentation, and the BUGS in the main code
(the main code is in "barracks.py")
